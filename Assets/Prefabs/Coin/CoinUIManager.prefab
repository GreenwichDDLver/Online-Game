  - Traveler, what you see before you is not an ordinary mausoleum corridor, but
    a forbidden corridor leading to the altar of Usekaf. Legend has it that in the
    era of Pharaoh Ramses Seti, ten of the most devout "Eye of Maat" priests served
    the goddess of truth and order, Maat (Maat). Each of them held a "Heart of Maat"
    amulet made of holy gold and meteoric iron, on which were engraved fragments
    of the law of cosmic harmony.
  - 'Thousands of years have passed. Today, the power of the seal is fading, and
    the dusty door of the Djed Pillar is showing a faint light. Legend has it that
    only by collecting the ten lost "Hearts of Maat" and placing them back on the
    sacred scales (The Scales of Maat) in the center of the altar, and letting the
    weight of truth overwhelm the falsehood, can the Djed Pillar, which symbolizes
    rebirth and stability, stand upright, opening the way to deeper wisdom (or salvation)
    for you.
